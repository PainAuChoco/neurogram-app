                        Neurogram is an ambitious art project which started in September 2020.
                        It's linking our brain and emotions to artwork creation using Artificial Intelligence.
                    </p>
                    Our vision is to firstly <b>record brain activity</b> with dry electrode electroencephalogram (EEG)
                    and <b>classify emotions</b> through a Brain-Computer interface.
                    The second challenge consists in using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
                    to <b>generate original artworks</b> corresponding to the appropriate feelings.
                </div>

                    <p>
                        We are a team of 7 young engineers specialized either in <b>Big Data&AI</b> and in <b>Health&Neurosciences</b>.
                    </p>
                    Our goal is to build a unique experience by bringing together the latest technologies from these fields.
                    <p>
                        We are also mentored by 3 teachers of our school, respectively experts in neurosciences, mathematics and signal processing.
                    </p>
                    Finally, we are helped by the artist collective <a target="_blank" href="https://obvious-art.com/">Obvious Art</a>, one of the pioneer in linking AI with artistic creation.

                        The key factor in any AI-oriented project is the amount of exploitable data to train the various algorithms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our generative network needs to be trained on the biggest amount of existing artwork to produce quality results.
                        We currently use the open-source database WikiArt which contains over 100,000 paintings ! Shoud be enough right ?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, as we are working with feelings, we have to link artworks with a range of emotion to train our
                        neural network to produce coherent pieces.
                    </p>
                    <h5 style={{color: "#007bff"}}>That's why we need you !</h5>
                    <p>
                        By choosing between a range of emotions on a few existing paintings,
                        you are playing a crucial role in the making of Neurogram ! From the votes of many people, we'll be able to be
                        even more precise and objective.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thank you for your interest and your participation !</p>
